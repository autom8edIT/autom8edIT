### Executive Summary

Highly versatile IT systems engineer and infrastructure tactician with over 20 years of experience in high-performance computing, automation, overclocking, and hardcore system customization.

Known internally as "The Machine" for output that exceeds team averages.

Combines unmatched technical intuition with raw efficiency, enabling elite performance in system hardening, endpoint control, and automation development.

Looking to relocate to the United States to work on forward-thinking infrastructure, cyber defense, and automation projects that empower Western innovation and digital sovereignty.

Nothing cool happens in Europe anymore - the only thing Europe creates nowadays is new laws  stagnating and many times straight up forbids innovation.

Have always wanted to live in the US anyway, the only thing that has kept me in Sweden is my family and friends but

### Core Competencies

* RAM-only architecture and stealth automation (TOTP, MFA, token workflows)
* PowerShell 5. 1& 7 / Python automation (privileged execution, GUI control, secure memory usage,)
* Windows internals, bloat removal, hardening, and system security
* Mac / OSX / PC Win10/11, Linux Ubuntu/Kali.
* Offensive mindset with defensive application (EDR bypass knowledge, ethical scope)
* Network stack control (firewall scripting, remote access lockdown, stealth tunneling)
* Overclocking and thermal/power management expert, been overclocking everything since my first computer.
* GitHub/GitOps flow, documentation discipline, automation branding (Autom8ed)

### Professional Experience

\*\* IT Expert \*\*

&#x20;University – IT Department
*2021–Present*

* Solved support cases exceeding the average technician rate
* Reverse engineered proprietary VPN clients and automated login across all endpoints
* Replaced manual 2FA workflows with fileless, memory-only Flask-based TOTP microservice
* Created GUI-driven automation platforms (Autom8ed Toolkit)
* Directly influenced policy and management decisions via precision, reliability, and speed.
* Developed stealth login wrappers and OS cleansing tools under strict endpoint compliance

---

### Key Achievements

* Developed one of the highest-overclocked 14900K systems in Sweden (6.4GHz all-core stable with only a LF2 420 AIO and a SP98 chip)
* Created RAM-only TOTP infrastructure for automatic Cisco VPN Client connection. Made a Chrome Extension for all other TOTP services, if you can use Google Authenticator you can add it to the Chrome extension for automatic instant injection, confirmed to work even on "serious" platforms like Office 365 and PasswordState.
* Building "Autom8ed.it" – a brand and platform for pushing stealth Windows control into usable GUI automation
* Successfully removed Defender, WaaSMedic, Xbox and other Windows 11 root components without detection
* Architected a self-healing `.env` and secrets vault into memory for production use

### Technology Arsenal

* **Languages:** PowerShell 7, Python 3, C#, HTML/CSS/JS, JSON
* **Tools:** Sysinternals Suite, Resource Hacker, Hyper-V, Simplewall, PowerRun, pyotp, Flask
* AI expert at ChatGPT, advanced user of CoPilot and Claude
* **Environments:** Windows 10/11, Linux, MacOS, Hyper-V, GitHub Actions, Secure endpoints (AAD/Intune) 
* **Hardware:** Prefer Intel CPUs (max overclocked), DDR5 tuning, custom thermal solutions but I can help you with getting the best flash memory, an enterprise router or a GPU cluster, I basically know all hardware available. Except AMD, the only product they offer of interest is ThreadRipper.
* **Specials:** Self-signed cert spoofing, silent deployment builders, GUI-injected auto-login agents and manipulated Powershell security files to give me System / NT Installer permissions whenever needed.

### Personal

I believe in high performance, no-nonsense execution, and building tools that empower users to control their digital environments. I'm passionate about supporting the researchers at the University to further innovation and the future of individual-centric computing.

Looking to bring this energy to a US-based role where tactical automation, cyber-hardening, and human-machine synergy matter.
If you want to use my scripts/tools or just have a look at what I can do to force Windows to do whatever I want you can have a look in my repo.
