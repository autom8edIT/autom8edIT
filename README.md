### Executive Summary

Highly versatile IT systems engineer and infrastructure tactician with over 20 years of experience in high-performance computing, automation, overclocking, and hardcore system customization.

Known as "The Machine" for focus, output and endurance that exceeds most people.

Combines unmatched technical intuition with raw efficiency, enabling elite performance in system hardening, endpoint control, and automation development.

Open to relocate to the United States to work on forward-thinking infrastructure, cyber defense, and automation projects that empower Western innovation and digital sovereignty.

The US innovates, China replicates and Europe regulates.

Have always wanted to live in the US, the only thing that has kept me in Sweden is my family and friends.

### Core Competencies

* RAM-only architecture and stealth automation (TOTP, MFA, token workflows, apps, scripts, you name it, I'll run it)
* PowerShell 5 & 7+ / Python automation (privileged execution, GUI control, secure memory usage, uninstalling, configuring etc.)
* Windows internals, bloat removal, hardening, and system security
* Mac / PC Win10/11, Linux Ubuntu/Kali.
* Offensive mindset with defensive application (EDR bypass knowledge, ethical scope)
* Network stack control (firewall scripting, remote access lockdown, stealth tunneling)
* Overclocking and thermal/power management expert, been overclocking everything since my first computer.
* GitHub/GitOps flow, Visual Studio 2022, VS Code, documentation discipline, automation branding (Autom8ed)

### Professional Experience

\*\* IT Expert \*\*

&#x20;University – IT Department
*2021–Present*
Pre 2021 SysAdmin at Mannheimer Swartling (https://www.mannheimerswartling.se), consultant/SysAdmin at InfoCare working under IBM's banner for AstraZeneca and other big companies, IT-Hantverkarna (small and mid size businesses).

* Solved support cases exceeding the average technician rate
* Reverse engineered proprietary VPN clients and automated login across all endpoints
* Replaced manual 2FA workflows with fileless, memory-only Flask-based TOTP microservice
* Created GUI-driven automation platforms (Autom8ed Toolkit)
* Directly influenced policy and management decisions via precision, reliability and speed.
* Monster Powershell $Profile with so many custom functions they all needed to be their own .ps1 but favorite obviously being TI elevation through my own compiled wsudo.
* Developed stealth login wrappers and OS cleansing tools under strict endpoint compliance.

---

### Key Achievements

* Developed one of the highest-overclocked 14900K systems in Sweden (6.4GHz all-core stable with only a LF2 420 AIO and a SP98 chip)
* Created RAM-only TOTP infrastructure for automatic Cisco VPN Client connection.
* Made a Chrome Extension for all other TOTP services, if you can use Google Authenticator you can add it to the Chrome extension for automatic instant injection, confirmed to work even on "serious" platforms like Office 365 and PasswordState.
* Building "Autom8ed.it" – a brand and platform for pushing stealth Windows control into usable GUI automation
* Successfully removed the entire Win11 Defender including all telemetry, Defender Advanced Threat Protection, WaaSMedic, UsoCoreWorker, Xbox and other Windows 11 root components without detection. Also locked everything with stub's and ACL's. Billy G can't ever touch my Windows again.
* Architected a self-healing `.env` and secrets vault into memory for production use
* Can deploy/run anything stealh injected at boot into encrypted and segmented running undetectable only from the RAM.
* Dissected and intercepted the entire Cisco VPN client and 2FA system so it can skip the username and password phase and connect direct to end 2FA URL.
* Created my own ISO building tool and custom Win11 ISO without any bloat or Defense/Telemetry crap.
* Was part of the team that built the Swdish IRS datacenter.

### Technology Arsenal

* **Languages:** PowerShell 5&7, Python 3x, C#, HTML/CSS/JS, JSON
* **Tools:** VStudio, VSCode, Sysinternals Suite, PowerRun, PrivExec, KDU, WinDBG, Resource Hacker, Hyper-V, VMware, pyotp, Flask, SimpleWall
* AI expert at ChatGPT, CoPilot and Claude
* **Environments:** Windows 10/11, Linux, macOS, Hyper-V, GitHub Actions, Secure endpoints (AAD/Intune) 
* **Hardware:** Prefer Intel CPUs (obviously max overclocked), DDR5 tuning, custom thermal solutions, but I can help you with getting the best flash memory, an enterprise router or a GPU cluster, I basically know all hardware available. Except AMD, the only product they offer of interest is ThreadRipper.
* **Specials:** Self-signed cert spoofing, silent deployment builders, GUI-injected auto-login agents and manipulated Powershell security files to give me System / NT Installer permissions whenever needed.
* Exploting task scheduler to run as Trusted Installer/System at boot to change the default access control lists and take ownership over what ever needed to delete or lock down a file folder, registery key.
* Making a map over MS new OS structure and ISO deployment. As an example System32 is basically a decoy now, WinSxS and Servicing/migration is the King & Queen folders of Win11.
* If ([System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent()).Groups | Where-Object { $_.Translate([System.Security.Principal.NTAccount]).Value -match "TrustedInstaller" } is not returning S-1-5-80-956008885 what are you even doing?
* If your ExecutionPolicy -List isn't returning MachinePolicy = Unrestricted, how are you ever going to be on top when all your scripts are stopped from executing?
*

### Personal

I believe in high performance, no-nonsense execution, and building tools that empower users to control their digital environments.
I'm passionate about supporting the researchers at the University to further innovation and the future of individual-centric computing.

Looking to bring this energy to a US-based role where tactical automation, cyber-hardening, and human-machine synergy matter.
If you want to use my scripts/tools or just have a look at what I can do to force Windows to do whatever I want you can have a look in my repo.
